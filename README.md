# ProducerConsumer
Newbery Novoa
The sorting method chosen is insertion sort because the vector to sort does not exceed 100 characters, which is a small size therefore has a good performance and also an easy implementation, like the bubble sort but this makes more comparisons what makes it less efficient, in conclusion insertion sort is the method chosen in this practice

run

./ProducerConsumer input.txt output.txt "sortMethod"

insertionSort
bubbleSort


./ProducerConsumer input.txt output.txt insertionSort
